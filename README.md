# Introduction

Pricing options is essential for financial institutions to assess the fair value and risk associated with these instruments. Accurate pricing supports informed investment decisions and enables effective hedging strategies, while inaccurate pricing can lead to inefficient hedging and potentially severe financial losses. Although option pricing can be complex, even relatively simple models can achieve a high degree of accuracy in certain scenarios. Several well-established models exist for pricing options, including the Black-Scholes model, the Heston model, and Dupire’s local volatility model. More recently, the rise of machine learning has spurred a growing body of research focused on using data-driven methods—such as neural networks, support vector regression, and decision trees—for option pricing. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of several common machine learning techniques in pricing American call options and demonstrate that even simple models can yield promising results.
